            <p className="myBio">
              I am a proud first generation American who was brought up by a
              strong grandfather. I am a proud husband and father. My wife
              Autumn has been my North Star in life. We are working hard to
              teach our children to leave the world a better place than they
              found it. As much as I enjoy rearing other peopleâ€™s biographies,
              resumes have always seemed like an odd format as I do NOT like
              talking about myself, but I believe I was taught the value of a
              strong work ethic, loyalty, and it is easy for me to get along
              with people as I like people very much. I am also a good learner
              yet not always the quickest one. My biggest weakness, I think, is
              focussing on one thing with too much intensity and missing the big
              picture at times and I also tend to have little patience for
              unnecessary corporate bureaucracy though I have learned to deal
              with it effectively. I hope to earn your trust and I will work
              tirelessly to become a valuable member of your team. I am willing
              and able to relocate anywhere in the continental United States and
              am legally authorized to work in the US for any employer.
